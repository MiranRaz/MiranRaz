### <h1 align="center">Hello</h1>
#### <h3 align="center">Basically a frontend developer here {but I'm full-stack (wink:wink) </h3>

**👁️ did you notice that i forgot to close the bracket up there 👁️...<br/>
If you did 🥷 and are looking 🕵️‍ for a developer 👨‍💻 we're gonna get along just fine 🤝🏼!<br/> But if you didn't, I probably won't talk to you 🤷‍♂️ (just-kidding 🙄)<br/>
So, what I want to tell you 🗣️ is that If you want me to solve your problems 🚩 -> I'm your guy! 🫡 But if you don't care about the details and refinement of coding... I just don't want to loose time ⌛ on bad products and projects 💀...<br/>
But again 🤔, we all make mistakes, so just contact me 📞 and we will figure something out  👍

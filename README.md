### <h1 align="center">Hello</h1>
#### <h3 align="center">Basically a frontend developer here {but I'm full-stack (wink:wink) </h3>

**👁️ did you notice that i forgot to close the bracket up there 👁️...
if you did 🥷 and are looking 🕵️‍ for a developer 👨‍💻 we're gonna get along just fine 🫶🏼! but if you didn't, I probably won't talk to you 🤷‍♂️.(just-kidding)
So, what I want to tell you is that If you want me to solve your problems 🚩 -> I'm your guy 🫡! but if you don't care about the details and refinement of coding... I just don't want to loose time on bad products and projects 💀... I want to work on something that's great and game changing, that helps to change the world and give it a new perspective and light on things!
